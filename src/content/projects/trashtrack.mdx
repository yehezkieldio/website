## Overview

TrashTrack is a smart waste disposal system that utilizes Internet of Things (IoT) technology and data analysis to monitor and sort waste efficiently and in real-time. Through a mobile application, users can view information about nearby waste disposal locations, report complaints related to waste disposal sites, and see analysis of collected waste data.

TrashTrack allows users to submit complaints and feedback regarding waste disposal sites, and if they are operators, they can monitor and manage these complaints and feedback and view analysis of the collected waste data through a dashboard.
